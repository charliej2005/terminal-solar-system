# Terminal Solar System

This is a Python project that runs a simple ASCII solar system in your Unix terminal.  
This project is my first [Boot.dev personal project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-personal-project-1)  
> note: unlike the [guided projects](https://github.com/stars/charliej2005/lists/boot-dev), this project is entirely my own.
